## About

The source code of [RasterTek](http://www.rastertek.com/tutdx11.html)'s DirectX 11 tutorials (made ready to use in Visual Studio 2017). Documentation and further explanation can be found at [RasterTek](http://www.rastertek.com/tutdx11.html).

These tutorials require the obsolete [DirectX 11 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812) which is very similar to the DirectX 11 component contained in the Windows SDK. With the exception of the use of D3DXMath (for which DIrectXMath is a superior and widely used alternative), nearly all code would remain the same. For more info, I refer to [Chuck Walbourn](https://github.com/walbourn)'s [Living without D3DX](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/chuckw/2013/08/20/living-without-d3dx/).
